## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow strict commit message conventions to maintain a clear and understandable project history.

### Key Principles

- **Write for a competent developer who does not know this part of the codebase.** Explain the local roles and specialized terms needed to understand the change when encountered in history, without reproducing a subsystem introduction.
- **You are the maintainer; write to a casual reader.** The commit message is you explaining the change to someone unfamiliar with the codebase. Never refer to maintainers in the third person.
- **Keep explanations within the commit history.** Do not refer to outside development context such as "the plan" or "review results". Explain the motivation directly, using only context available at that point in the series.
- **Use series context to explain this patch.** Retain prerequisites, design choices, consumer contracts, and intentionally unfinished scope. Put the series-wide overview and recap in the review request or cover letter.
- **Separate independent series.** A dirty worktree can contain multiple unrelated commit series. Keep their explanations separate instead of forcing one narrative across all unstaged changes.
- **Explain groundwork where it matters.** Name the later capability that motivates a preparatory patch, regardless of the patch's position in the series.
- **Let structure follow the explanation.** State, problem, and solution are questions to answer, not paragraph assignments. Being first or last creates no introduction or conclusion duty.
- **Keep narrative present tense.** Describe the existing behavior from the viewpoint of the previous commit, then describe what the current commit changes. Prefer `This commit ...` for that transition wherever it belongs.
- **Use imperative voice only in the summary.** Every body sentence is an indicative, declarative statement. Never instruct the reader in the body.
- **Explain the actual reason at the smallest scope that makes it understandable.** Describe concrete consequences when they matter, without inflating a local change into a project-wide limitation. Internal simplification, removal of an unused argument, or clarification of a contract can be sufficient reasons.
- **Distinguish evidence from inference.** Do not invent reported failures, benchmarks, testing history, or rejected alternatives.
- **Be precise about scope.** If a change only improves one aspect of a problem, do not imply it fully solves it. Verify that the patch makes an operation run before describing the program as beginning it. A new helper or internal representation is a legitimate outcome even when callers will adopt it separately.
- **If the commit is a step toward a larger feature, say so explicitly.** Describe the end goal briefly, then explain how this commit moves toward it.
- **Name the feature goal in early groundwork commits.** If a commit mainly exists to enable a later user-facing feature, say what that feature is and why it matters instead of presenting the commit as isolated infrastructure work.
- **Prefer concrete limitations over vague judgments.** Avoid words like "cumbersome", "better", or "improved" without explaining why.
- **Do not use `Co-Authored-By` for contributions produced by artificial intelligence.** Only use it for human co-authors.
- **Only use the word `this` when referring to the commit itself.** Use `that` or similar for other contexts.
- **Wrap body paragraphs at 75 characters.**
- **Be humble and forward thinking.** Avoid words like "comprehensive" or "crucial", and avoid a tone that could sound like bragging or seem short-sighted.
- **Do not invent concise self-describing labels for internal ideas and use them casually,** expecting the reader to implicitly know what they should mean. Explain things in a way that reduces cognitive load on the reader.
- **Build context across the series.** Give shared background where it first matters. Later commits may rely on that explanation; keep useful repetition, but make it a shorter reminder rather than repeating the detail. Add new detail where it becomes relevant. A standalone commit still needs its own context.
- **Define codebase-specific or ambiguous terms when first introduced in the series.** Use a concise role reminder later when it helps, rather than repeating the full definition in every message.
- **Prefer a complete plain-language sentence over compressed shorthand.** Spell out the behavior hidden by noun piles, abstract verbs, or compounds such as `X-backed` and `X-aware` when their meaning is not obvious.

### Format

State, problem, and solution are questions to answer, not paragraphs to fill.
Combine them when separation repeats the same fact, and omit background the
subject or problem already establishes. A mechanical cleanup may need one
sentence; a one-line correctness fix may need several paragraphs. The topics
below guide the explanation without assigning paragraphs.

#### First Line (Summary)

```
prefix: Concise summary of the change
```

- Use a short, lowercase prefix (`project:`, `cli:`, `patch:`, `editor:`, `state:`, etc.). Prefer the affected subsystem over generic `fix:` or `refactor:` labels when prefixes are free-form; Conventional Commits and other declared type-based formats take precedence.
- Capitalize the first word of the summary after the colon
- Keep the entire line under 72 characters
- If unsure which prefix to use, run `git log --pretty=oneline FILE` and see what prefixes were used previously

#### Relevant State

Establish the program's selected state at this point in history. If recent
work established that state, briefly recount the change in past tense and
loosely when it happened.

Describe the status quo in present tense from the viewpoint of the code
after the previous commit. Use a light cue such as `Right now, ...`,
`Currently, ...`, or `As things stand, ...` when it helps distinguish
time-dependent behavior from the change. `This commit ...` supplies the
transition wherever the explanation needs it.

Do not add a cue automatically to the first paragraph. Timeless background
or a lasting contract can stand unqualified; naming the project or component
may already make the context clear. For example, `Mutter redraws or copies
damaged regions` does not need `Right now`. If the ambiguity is in the problem
paragraph, anchor that claim instead: `Currently, buffer repair does not
consistently follow that rule.`

Avoid routinely attaching `Before this commit is applied, ...` to background
facts, since that invites a contrast even when those facts remain true
afterward.

Use `already` selectively to contrast an established capability with an
extension the patch needs. Verify it against the previous commit; do not
use the word merely to mean that something exists before the current patch.

When the relevant state comes from a recent change, describe that change
as a past event and identify it as earlier work: `Recent commits moved
buffer selection and damage history into the copy tracker.` Present tense
describes an existing state; past tense can recount the recent change that
established it. Avoid `now` alone for that transition, since it can make
the current commit sound responsible. Do not anticipate later work.

When a cue helps, use it where it resolves the ambiguity without repeating
it throughout the message. Vary the wording naturally; some repetition is
preferable to forced synonyms. Keep present tense for the change itself,
such as `This commit returns NULL on failure`, and future tense for later
work.

In message prose, use `commit`, not `revision`, and `previous commit`, not
`parent commit`.

Summarize what capabilities, interfaces, or documentation exist in the
project immediately before this commit is applied. This is the program's
state, not the user's situation. Focus on what the program has or provides,
not on what users must do or cannot do.

If this commit is part of a series, describe the relevant state after the
previous commit. Do not claim later work already exists, but do not recap
unrelated earlier work either. A French translation does not need a list of
languages added by preceding commits.

If the patch mainly exists to enable a later feature, explain that connection
where it helps establish the problem or design. Do not describe it as generic
cleanup when a specific capability motivates the work.

Combine that background with the problem or change when separate paragraphs
would repeat the same fact.

#### Problem

Explain the underlying problem from the appropriate perspective.

**Choose the perspective based on who experiences the problem:**
- Use **first-person maintainer perspective** for internal concerns (missing infrastructure, lack of test coverage, missing translations, build system gaps). You are the maintainer — frame as "The program lacks X" or "The project does not provide Y", never as "Maintainers cannot X."
- Use **user perspective** for external concerns (confusing interfaces, missing documentation, poor workflows). Frame as "Users cannot X" or "Users must Y."

Describe what is non-obvious, hard to discover, confusing, missing, or limited
about the selected state. Explain the actual reason at the smallest scope that
makes it understandable. Do not broaden a local reason merely to make the
patch sound important.

Useful tests:
- Does the explanation identify the actual reason for this patch?
- Is this something users would notice, or only you as the maintainer?

When a helper exists specifically for a later capability, explain that
capability and the constraint it places on the helper. The relationship matters
because it explains the design, regardless of the commit's position.

#### Change

Describe how the commit addresses one part of that problem.

Be precise about scope. If the commit only addresses one path (such as the man
page, command help, or internal structure), say so clearly rather than implying
the entire problem is solved.

If the commit introduces infrastructure or an early step toward a larger
feature, describe it as such.

Describe the capability or intermediate state established by the patch.
Do not force "begins", "continues", or "completes" wording based on position.

Prefer `This commit ...` to mark the change in narrative present tense.
It can share a paragraph with the reason when that reads naturally. Do not
repeat the subject merely to supply a concluding solution paragraph.

Use natural prose such as:
- `This commit addresses that by ...`
- `This commit begins adding support for ... by ...`
- `This commit lays groundwork for ... by ...`

#### Series Context

A commit message explains its own change. Series context belongs in the
message when it explains a prerequisite, design choice, contract with a
consumer, or deliberately unfinished scope.

For each reference, identify the particular fact about this patch it explains.
Would removing it make the patch's reason, design, or stopping point unclear?
If removing it only loses knowledge of what happens elsewhere, remove it.
Merely sharing a topic or appearing next in the series is not enough.

For example, a full-damage representation change can explain why a later
shadow-copy patch can use ordinary region operations. An unused-argument
cleanup should not merely announce that the next commit fixes failed GPU
copies; it needs a meaningful connection to that work.

Describe a necessary relationship where it belongs in the explanation.
It need not occupy a separate paragraph or repeat the current patch's reason.

Being first, last, or adjacent to another commit creates no obligation to
introduce, summarize, or conclude the series. Put the series-wide overview and
recap in the review request or cover letter, while retaining the rationale
that belongs to this patch.

Verify references against actual patches. Describe work in later commits in
future tense and do not claim it is already implemented. Make references to
those commits explicit: `in a later commit`, `later commits will ...`, or
`the final commit will ...`, not bare `later`. For example, write `the
tracker introduced in a later commit`, not `the tracker introduced later`.
When a retained segue refers only to the upcoming final commit, use the
singular. Preserve useful connections; remove unrelated recaps, next-item
announcements, and repetitive boilerplate. Varying the wording does not make
an irrelevant segue useful.

### Checklist

Before finalizing a commit message, check:

- Does the summary use a fitting prefix and stay under 68 characters?
- Does the description of existing behavior match the state before the patch?
- Is the status quo clear, with temporal cues only where they resolve an
  ambiguity rather than make lasting background sound temporary?
- Does any `already` claim identify an existing capability the patch builds
  on, rather than assume later work?
- Does the message use declarative body sentences and narrative present tense?
- Does the selected state match the previous commit without recapping
  unrelated earlier work?
- If the worktree contains multiple independent series, are they split into separate series?
- Can you name the particular fact about this patch that each cross-commit reference explains?
- Does the message contain the reasoning needed to understand this patch when encountered in history?
- Are unrelated roadmaps, recaps, and next-item announcements omitted?
- Does the explanation use the appropriate perspective (first-person maintainer for internal concerns, user for external concerns)?
- Does it describe the actual reason without artificially broadening the scope?
- If the patch is groundwork, does it explain the later capability that motivates the design?
- Does the explanation clearly state what this commit does without overstating its impact or claiming later integration?
- If this is an incremental step, does it clearly say so?
- Would removing any cross-commit reference make this patch's reason, design, or stopping point unclear?
- Is retained series context accurate, brief, and not repeated elsewhere in the message?
- Does every paragraph add necessary information beyond the subject and other paragraphs?
- Can a newcomer understand the state, limitation, and change without decoding coined shorthand?
- Are unfamiliar terms introduced where they first matter, with concise reminders where later messages need them?
- Does repeated context become more concise while retaining what helps explain the current patch?
- Do body paragraphs wrap at 75 characters?

### Example: Single Commit

```
cli: Add --verbose flag for detailed output

Right now, the command-line interface provides minimal feedback during
operation. It only shows the selected hunk, without any indication of
progress or internal state.

Users working with large changesets cannot easily determine how much work
remains or what has already been processed, making it difficult to gauge
progress and reason about unexpected behavior.

This commit addresses that lack of visibility by adding a --verbose flag that
displays additional information including the number of hunks processed, total
hunks remaining, and the selected hunk's position in the sequence. The flag is
optional and preserves the existing terse output when not specified.
```

### Example: Commit Series

The representation change explains the contract that its consumer will use.
The consumer's message explains why its existing special case is no longer
needed. Their positions create no introduction or conclusion duty.

**Commit 1:**

```text
renderer: Represent full redraws with explicit damage

Right now, full redraws use an empty damage region to mean "copy
everything". Rendering and shadow-buffer copies each interpret that
special value.

Ordinary region operations instead treat an empty region as containing no
pixels, so the special value cannot describe a full redraw directly.

This commit represents full redraws with the framebuffer rectangle,
allowing region operations to describe the complete update directly.

That representation will let the shadow-copy path remove its empty-region
special case and use the damage supplied by the renderer.
```

**Consumer commit:**

```text
renderer: Use supplied shadow buffer damage

The preceding commit changed full redraws to supply a region covering the
framebuffer.

Shadow buffer copies still translate an empty region into a full copy,
even though the supplied region already describes all pixels to copy.

This commit passes the supplied region directly to the copy operation,
removing the special case.
```

By contrast, an unused-argument cleanup does not need "The next commit will
fix failed GPU copies." That sentence announces another patch without
explaining the cleanup's role, even if both patches touch the same function.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Don't write in past tense about the old state:**
```
The code used to only show minimal output...
```

✅ **Do write in present tense about the selected state:**
```
Right now, the code provides minimal output...
```

❌ **Don't use imperative body sentences:**
```
Add verbose output to the command-line interface.
```

✅ **Do describe the change in narrative present tense:**
```
This commit adds verbose output to the command-line interface.
```

❌ **Don't leave a non-obvious reason unexplained:**
```
Users reading the man page cannot discover that interactive mode exists.
```

✅ **Do explain the relevant consequence:**
```
Interactive mode is not obvious for a tool that otherwise presents itself as a
command-line interface.
```

✅ **Then describe the narrower gap if relevant:**
```
The man page does not currently help users discover or understand that mode.
```

❌ **Don't invent a broader reason for a local cleanup:**
```
Unused parameters prevent the rendering subsystem from evolving.
```

✅ **Do explain the actual reason, even when it is brief:**
```
copy_shared_framebuffer_cpu() does not use renderer_gpu_data. This commit
removes the parameter from the helper and its caller.
```

❌ **Don't use vague value judgments:**
```
The command-line interface is cumbersome to use.
```

✅ **Do describe concrete limitations:**
```
The command-line interface requires repeated command invocation and does not
provide a continuous hunk-by-hunk workflow.
```

❌ **Don't overstate the impact of the commit:**
```
This commit solves discoverability of interactive mode.
```

✅ **Do be precise about scope:**
```
This commit addresses that by documenting the workflow in the man page.
```

❌ **Don't describe the program's state inaccurately in a series:**
```
i18n: Add French translation (fr)

The application outputs all user-facing text in English.

Users who speak other languages must work in English...
```

✅ **Do describe the relevant state after previous commits:**
```
i18n: Add French translation (fr)

Currently, the program uses fallback English messages for the French
locale.

Without French translations, French-speaking users cannot use the
program in their native language...
```

❌ **Don't leave the affected state ambiguous:**
```
i18n: Add French translation (fr)

Users must work in English regardless of their preference.
```

✅ **Do describe the program's state:**
```
i18n: Add French translation (fr)

Currently, the program uses fallback English messages for the French
locale.
```

## Making Changes

1. **Keep commits atomic.** Each commit should represent one logical change.
2. **Use the `git-stage-batch` tool itself** to help stage micro-commits from larger working directory changes.
3. **Follow existing code style.** The project uses standard Python conventions.

### Commit Series Ordering

Order multi-commit series as repeated implementation steps and their related
follow-up commits:

```text
implementation -> tests (-> man page -> bash completion -> website)
implementation -> tests (-> man page -> bash completion -> website)
...
```

Do not put several implementation commits first and then collect the test,
documentation, completion, or website commits at the end. Each test,
documentation, completion, or website commit should sit immediately after the
smallest implementation commit it validates or exposes.

If one implementation change needs more than one follow-up commit because of
repository rules, keep those follow-ups together before moving to the next
implementation. Use the order `tests`, then man page, then bash completion,
then website unless a specific dependency requires otherwise.

When shared groundwork is needed, commit the groundwork first. Then repeat the
same grouped pattern for each command, workflow, or implementation that adopts
that groundwork.
